# MiniForum

MiniForum is a web application for creating and managing discussion forums. Users can post topics, comment on discussions, and interact in real-time. The project demonstrates full-stack web development using:

- **Frontend:** React (for a dynamic and interactive user interface).
- **Backend:** Express.js with REST API(for handling APIs and user authentication).

This project is a showcase of my skills in building scalable and modern web applications with javascript.
